## Overview 
SOH is a platform that bridges the gap between surplus food and those who need it most. We work with a network of farmers, restaurants, bakeries, and individuals to collect food donations, which are then distributed to orphanages, homes, and women in local communities who cook for their neighbors. Additionally, we empower unemployed women by teaching them how to grow crops and turn their harvest into thriving businesses. These women also volunteer their time to help manage the food distribution process, ensuring that donations reach those in need efficiently and effectively.

## Features

- **Donor Page**: Allows individuals and organizations to donate surplus food that can be distributed to those in need.
- **Volunteer Management**: Enables volunteers to coordinate food distribution efforts, ensuring that donations are properly managed.
- **Educational Resources**: Provides tools and information for women to learn about farming, business management, and entrepreneurship.
